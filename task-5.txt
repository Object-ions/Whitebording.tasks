Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]

Solution A:

function compString(userInput) {
    for (let i = 0; i < userInput.length; i++) {
        let count = 1;
        while (i + 1 < userInput.length && userInput.charAt(i) == userInput.charAt(i+1))
        {
            i++;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
